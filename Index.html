    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a gamer who has decided to learn about coding. Seeing all the crazy things
        that video games could do intrigued me beyond belief and so one day I decided
        that learning coding would be what I wanted to do. I find doing things like
        jogging and biking to be fun at times, but I tend to prefer the sheltered indoor
        life. My favorite series from just about everything would have to be 
        <a href="https://www.zelda.com/" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda</a> by far.

    <h2>Family and Friends</h2>
    <p>
        I have a fairly extensive family on both sides of my family. As for my immediate family,
        I have two sides because of my parents divorce. On my mom's side, I'm usually around my
        mom with my stepdad Chris being around usually very early in the mornings and Sundays. My
        older brother just graduated from high school and has chosen to no longer go to my dad's
        house anymore because of many conflicting things that have happened. My older sister also 
        lives primarily at my mom's and works two jobs to pay off rent. For the most part, I'm at 
        my mom's as well currently to be able to drive myself to my internship with Nextech.

    <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I took computer science 1 sophomore year in high school with my teacher Mr. Law.
        We started on Scratch and after the first project, Mr. Law told me that I was
        good enough to go on to AP Computer programming next year. During that first year
        though, we worked on Scratch, then moved onto a small bit of Python and did Visual
        Basic for the rest of the year. The next year when I was in AP Computer Programming,
        I worked with Java the entire year
