    <p id='intro'>
        Many of the projects that I have done have been in Java as that's the language
        I started in with my AP computer programming class, but I now have a fair few
        that I have now from my time at Nextech.^^
        Here is a list of my projects and links to them. They are all part of this website^^
        Dungeon Crawler was a game which was originally designed by me in Java, but I^
        worked hard to import it into JavaScript from scratch. All parts of it were^
        recreated during the time of the Nextech Catapult internship
