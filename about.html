    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id='about'>
        I'm a gamer who has decided to learn about coding. Seeing all the crazy things
        that video games could do intrigued me beyond belief and so one day I decided
        that learning coding would be what I wanted to do. I find doing things like            jogging and biking to be fun at times, but I tend to prefer the sheltered indoor
        life. My favorite series from just about everything would have to be 
        <a href="https://www.zelda.com/" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda</a> by far.

    <h2>Family and Friends</h2>
    <p id='family'>
        I have a fairly extensive family on both sides of my family.<br> As for my immediate family,
        I have two sides because of my parents divorce.<br> On my mom's side, I'm usually around my
        mom with my stepdad Chris being around usually very early in the mornings and Sundays.<br> My
        older brother just graduated from high school and has chosen to no longer go to my dad's
        house anymore because of many conflicting things that have happened.<br> My older sister also 
        lives primarily at my mom's and works two jobs to pay off rent.<br> For the most part, I'm at 
        my mom's as well currently to be able to drive myself to my internship with Nextech.

    <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
    <p id='exp'>
        I took computer science 1 sophomore year in high school with my teacher Mr. Law.
        We started on Scratch and after the first project, Mr. Law told me that I was
        good enough to go on to AP Computer programming next year. During that first year
        though, we worked on Scratch, then moved onto a small bit of Python and did Visual
       Basic for the rest of the year. The next year when I was in AP Computer Programming,
        I worked with Java the entire year
